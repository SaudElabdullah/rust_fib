# Rust Build withPython

This is a simple application that shows how to use Rust to build a Python module and use it in a FastAPI application.

## Motivation

One of my friends kept sending and retweeting a tweet on X that shows how fast Rust and typescript compare to Python.
I hated that even though I knew about it. However, the second motivation was to try doing this and see how other did it.

## Start

Task up: To start the application.

Task down: To stop the application.

Task rebuild_images: To rebuild the images.

## Components

- FastAPI: A web framework.
- Rust: A programming language.
- Cargo: A package manager for Rust.
- Maturin: A tool to build and publish Rust crates to PyPI.

## Use Case

Sometimes you need to be light and fast.

I wrote this in Osama Apartment in Leads, UK. Looking at the window and enjoying the very cold weather.
